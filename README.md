# odin-recipes
The Odin Project: Recipe Project
>**Goals**
	>- Practice with git and github
	>- Create a website from basic HTML
	>- Practice with proper file structuring
### What I Learned
- VS Code has Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation that allowed me to create an unordered list without having to individually type out the `<li></li>` tags on each line.
    - You can use it for all other tags as well making it easier to edit prexisting text.
- Created a template file from the first recipe tutorial
	- Used the `cp` command to copy the template file & rename it to the new recipe I wanted to add.\
